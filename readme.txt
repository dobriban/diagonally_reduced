Dobriban, Leeb, Singer: PCA from noisy, linearly reduced data: the diagonal case

Uses software from Dobriban's EigenEdge package, available at: github.com/dobriban/EigenEdge. That place also has documentation. The functions from EigenEdge used here are:

general_spiked_forward.m
compute_esd_ode.m
compute_esd_fp.m
evaluate_inverse_ST.m
standard_spiked_forward.m
